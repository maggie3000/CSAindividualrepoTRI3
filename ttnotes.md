## Tech Talk 1

*Paradigms*\
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
- Imperative paradigms: Uses statements to change a programâ€™s state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
- Object Oriented paradigms: Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows OOP.

*Data Structures*\
Some common data structures that java uses to store information include: Array lists, hashmaps, and algorithms (such as recursion).
