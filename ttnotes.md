# Tech Talk Notes
In this section, I will take notes before and during tech talks about the topics that will be discussed in class as a group. I will come prepared with questions and present them to the next meeting.

### Data Structures
Some common data structures that java uses to store information include: Array lists, hashmaps, and algorithms (such as recursion).
### Paradigms
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
- *Imperative paradigms:* Uses statements to change a programâ€™s state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
- *Object Oriented paradigms:* Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows Object Oriented Programming

### Linked Lists
- linked lists are way of keeping and managing a list of Objects
### Queues
- *FIFO:* first in first out
- nodes
      - *tail node:* the last object of the list
      - *head node:* the first object of the list
      - *current node:* must be kept track of for iteration
- enqueue and dequeue
    - *enqueue:* increases the queue from the tail node
    - *dequeue:* decreases the queue from the head node
- the previous node or the last node is null if something isn't there
### Stacks
- *LIFO:* last in first out
- push and pop
    *push:* adds new node to the top of the stack
    *pop:* removes node from the top of the stack
