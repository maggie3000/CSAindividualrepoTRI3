# AP Exam Test Prep

## Overview
This page outlines my weekly plan for studying for the AP Exam. I will first target the topics that I am struggling with the most, then review the ones that I am already familiar with.

**TOPICS (in order):**
1. recursion
2. 2D arrays
3. iteration
4. arraylist
5. primitive types
6. array
7. using objects
8. inheritance
9. boolean expressions and if statements
10. writing classes

### General Plan
- review old test corrections
- watch collegeboard videos on topics I am confused on
- create a Java playground to test out Java code
- find practice FRQs on the internet and do practice tests
- find practice MC on the internet and do practice tests
- make a cram sheet

## Plan

### Week 1
* create github page for AP Exam prep
* identify the topics that I know well and the topics that I know the least (order them)

### Week 2
* review old test corrections
* begin cram sheet
* watch collegeboard videos on 2D arrays

### Week 3 (and beyond)
* TBD as dates come closer
